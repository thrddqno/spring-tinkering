## Learning Goals

By finishing this multi-module journey, I aim to:

- Develop strong fundamentals in REST API design, data modeling, validation, and error handling
- Learn to structure clean, maintainable, and scalable backend systems using proper architecture
- Progress from simple CRUD applications to production-style systems with authentication, modularization, and system design thinking
- Build consistency, discipline, and engineering depth through repeated implementation and iteration
- Create a body of work that reflects my growth from beginner to capable backend engineer
