# spring-tinkering

A multi-module project containing all my attempt at [Backend Project Ideas](https://roadmap.sh/backend/projects) from `roadmap.sh`

## Projects
To finish this multi-module project, I will have to finish 5 beginner-level projects, 3 intermediate-level projects, and 2 advanced-level projects.

| Project | Difficulty | Type | Description |
|---------|------------|------|-------------|
|[Todo list API](link.com)|`beginner-level`|API|Build a RESTful API to allow users to manage their to-do list.|

## Learning Goals
By finishing this multi-module journey, I aim to:
- Develop strong fundamentals in REST API design, data modeling, validation, and error handling
- Learn to structure clean, maintainable, and scalable backend systems using proper architecture
- Progress from simple CRUD applications to production-style systems with authentication, modularization, and system design thinking
- Build consistency, discipline, and engineering depth through repeated implementation and iteration
- Create a body of work that reflects my growth from beginner to capable backend engineer
