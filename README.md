A repo containing all my attempts at [Backend Project Ideas](https://roadmap.sh/backend/projects) from `roadmap.sh`

## Projects

To finish these challenges, I will have to finish 5 beginner-level projects, 3 intermediate-level projects, and 2 advanced-level projects.

| Project                           | Difficulty       | Type | Description                                                    | Roadmap.sh Project URL | 
| --------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |-----------------------|
| [Todo list API](01-todo-list-api) | `beginner-level` | API  | Build a RESTful API to allow users to manage their to-do list. |[Todo list API](https://roadmap.sh/projects/todo-list-api)|

## Learning Goals

By finishing this multi-module journey, I aim to:

- Develop strong fundamentals in REST API design, data modeling, validation, and error handling
- Learn to structure clean, maintainable, and scalable backend systems using proper architecture
- Progress from simple CRUD applications to production-style systems with authentication, modularization, and system design thinking
- Build consistency, discipline, and engineering depth through repeated implementation and iteration
- Create a body of work that reflects my growth from beginner to capable backend engineer
